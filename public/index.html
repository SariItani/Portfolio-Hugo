<div class="prose prose-stone dark:prose-invert max-w-none">
<p>Check out my blog post on <a href="./blog/post_3/">strategies to run ARC and IEEE-CIS</a></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Launch, March 2023</em>: The group who worked on the <a href="https://github.com/SariItani/BAU-Engineering-Day">&ldquo;Cafeteria Madness&rdquo;</a> game formed the AI and Robotics club (ARC) committee and showcased the game during launch and accepted applications for people to start joining the ARC club.</li>
<li><em>Engineering Day, May 2023</em>: We got recognised as an established club by the faculty of engineering by receiving a certificate.</li>
<li><em>Orientation, August 2023</em>: We showcased, in a short presentation, What ARC is and Why students would want to join ARC, accepting registration applications from the new first year students.</li>
<li><em>Booth, September 2023</em>: We Annuonced our main plans for the semester in the form of a road map, showcased What ARC is and Why students would want to join, and accepted new registration applications.</li>
<li><em>AI and Robotics Debate &amp; Trivia day, October 2023</em>: It was a failed attempt to start weekly or monthly club meetings, we debated a broad pool of topics and voted for those who got a point and in the end announced which side wins for each topic.</li>
<li><em>Ethical Hacking, October 2023</em>: We collabed with Semicolon-Academy to introduce students to the area of cybersecurity in an interactive seminar.</li>
<li><em>ROS2, November 2023</em>: We collabed with Eng. Abboud Hayek to introduce students to the area of robotics and showcase robotics development with ROS2 framework.</li>
<li><em>NLP, November 2023</em>: We collabed with Eng. Lara Wehbe to introduce students to the area of NLP in AI and showcase the process of an LLM.</li>
<li><em>Innovation, December 2023</em>: We collabed with DR. Ahmad El Hajj to spread awareness on the importance of innovating in our university years especially as engineering students.</li>
<li><em>Huawei HCAI, December 2023</em>: Logistics Management ofthe program.</li>
<li><em>Launch, April 2024</em>: ARC club was expanding and required financial support for upcoming ambitious projects, so ARC became IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (CIS) student branch.</li>
<li><em>Zaka/Beirut AI Workshop, May 2024</em>: IEEE Computational Intelligence Society collaborated with Zaka AI to deliver an extensive workshop entitled &ldquo;AI development: from university knowledge to workplace skills&rdquo;, which is self explanatory, introducing the tech stacks and skills and workflows that an AI engineer does on the job.</li>

      <b>Idea:</b> Language translation and voice generation have seen significant advancements, but current systems often lack the ability to capture the subtleties of human speech. This project proposes a solution that combines transformer-based language translation models with voice cloning techniques to deliver a more immersive and authentic translation experience. By utilizing the power of cloud-based AI platforms, real-time audio interception, and deep learning algorithms, our system aims to generate voiceovers that mirror the speaker&#39;s tone, mood, and pitch in the target language. With a user- friendly interface and a focus on maintaining privacy and ethical standards, our solution addresses the limitations of existing automatic translation systems and strives to provide a professional and engaging communication tool.<br>

  <a href="https://github.com/SariItani/Password-Manager-Java-App" target="_blank">CLI Java Password Manager</a>
  
</h4>
<p class="markdownify indent-8">Created a XOR and rotating key based encryption algorithm that decreases probability of cracking the password <em>exponentially</em> in powers of 2, and implemented it in a nice looking, ascii-art based CLI application that is built with Java so it would be available on any device. The password database is even made with a custom .dat file to avoid sneaky decryptions from hackers.</p>

  <b style="color: rgb(122, 122, 122);">Robot Mania</b>
</h4>
<p class="markdownify indent-8">In a planned <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bau_arc/">ARC</a> event, an obstacle course is randomly generated, and 2 teams are supposed to compete against one another by building a robot and training its movements using reinforcement learning, or by hardcoding its movements, so that the controls are managed by ROS2 operating system that will run the Genetic Algorithm on both team&rsquo;s robots and attempt to pass the obstacle course fair and square. This experience is proposed to be gamified using Unity and published on <a href="https://itch.io">itch.io</a>.</p>

  <b style="color: rgb(122, 122, 122);">Water Waste Management</b>
</h4>
<p class="markdownify indent-8">In a collab between ARC and the Chemical Engieering Student Society, our project aim is to implement state-of-the-art techniques for water waste management systems using embedded systems and microcontrollers like PIC61F877A with the appropriate sensors provided by the chemical students, based on the environment variables and project scope and budget. It was discontinued however due to lack of interest from the students in the clubs.</p>

</h4>
<p class="markdownify indent-8">Imagine this: You wear a hemlet, and everyone aroud you would hear music from your head! The project is an EEG-scanner that interprets EEG signals into music through MIDI files. It was proposed but rejected since it does not have academic importance in the field of engineering, as compared to a mental health application of the same helmet.</p>

  <b style="color: rgb(122, 122, 122);">Log Analysis using AI: Random Forrest for user classification behind each log</b>
</h4>
<p class="markdownify indent-8">Hackers and cyber criminals, even normal criminals, are using the internet everyday. An international station like Google and the CIA is more than capable of profiling people based on their network traffic and server logs from around the world. This project aims to use Random Forrests to detect anomalies in analysed server logs and trace it back to a pool of profiled users who could have caused this anomaly, which is the crime. The users however are none other than clusters of logs.</p>

<p class="markdownify indent-8">Check the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XnvngM-qFsdWI_N3AjPV1AAKQ0NfJ6dk/view?usp=sharing">PDF</a> for a detailed description of this project proposal. The idea is that everything in the universe has a unique sound, and that is a direct consequence of chaos theory. We see that demonstrated in this project. We can extract the sound of every touchable object in the universe. Each object has a unique surface distribution of atoms, and using a piezo electric material, we can track the distribution of these atoms on the surface, or, if not the atoms, then the unique surface structure to that material. Then, since we have an electric signal, what we can do is infinitely repeat it many times bu rolling the piezo electric material over and over again at the material surface to generate loops in the signal, thus extracting music as verified by fourier transform.</p>

  <b style="color: rgb(122, 122, 122);">From Relative to Real: A Vision Model for Absolute 3D Understanding</b>
</h4>
<p class="markdownify indent-8">This project proposes a novel vision model that transcends relative depth perception and strives towards absolute 3D scene understanding. The issue with our human vision is that we perceive depth with 2 dimensional images in our head at all times. We want to be able to see objects in their true size no matter how far away they are, so identical objects will appear identical at a distance from one another. Moreover, distances on the 3 spacial axis must still persist and appear.</p>

  <b style="color: rgb(122, 122, 122);">AI Avatar Creator</b>
</h4>
<p class="markdownify indent-8">In our meta-world, humans are relying more on their meta-personas to define their identities than ever before. This means that soon, we will need IDs on the internet, similar to the national IDs we physically hold, which is probably the area of block chain technology. However, assuming that such a secret private key exists, which defines your presence online, then we can create an AI that will scan your face and be able to detect your face forever more, then generate this secret key and integrate it for you in an online identity, so you can for example embed your secret key in any game and get a skin that looks like your meta-self. This is the avatar generator I proposed.</p>

  <b style="color: rgb(122, 122, 122);">DNA Based Processor</b>
</h4>
<p class="markdownify indent-8">DNA is used to store data in state-of-the-art research. However, what people overlook is that DNA strands have encoded information (ACTG =&gt; ACUG) which are then decoded by mRNA and thus generate a sequence of instructions based on codons, tripplets of information (AUCG), and a sequence of these codons create a certain instruction. And so, an instruction set is defined and complex instructions can arise. This has the potential to become an interactive game where your goal is to design the perfect DNA of a living micro organism and understand the intricacies of life itself, or a hobbiest project that is the DNA based Microprocessor.</p>
