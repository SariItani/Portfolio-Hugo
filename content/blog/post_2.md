By far, one of the most common utility of IOT in the industry is the field of : Autonomous and Connected Vehicles

One of the most promising IoT use cases is in creating smarter, more efficient cities. Public energy grids can be optimized to balance workloads, predict energy surges, and distribute energy more equitably to customers.

### Economic Experts Approve:
In a first stage of the move towards Industry 4.0the most immediate consequence of applying digital processes is a drop in operational costs. But this is all part of a more ambitious process.

### For Example:
Many projects launched recently by large companies like Ferrovial, Iberdrola, Endesa, Adif, and Renfe or Repsol, applying innovation as a means of making more efficient use of existing infrastructures, and of adding value to structures built from scratch.  

According to an [ONVIA report](http://www.onvia.com/business-resources/white-papers/3-trends-shaping-state-and-local-contracting-in-2016), there are several trends providing a competitive advantage in the contracting of public works, one of which is linked to the development of smart infrastructure.
